# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer by clicking on the buttons for rock, paper, or scissors.

## Features

- User can select rock, paper, or scissors by clicking the corresponding button.
- The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.
- The game displays the result (win, lose, or tie) based on the user's and computer's choices.
- The result is shown using alert messages.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the rock, paper, or scissors button to make your choice.
3. The computer will make its choice randomly.
4. An alert message will display the result of the game.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure

The HTML file includes the following key elements:

- A `div` container for the game.
- Three buttons for rock, paper, and scissors, each with an image.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) styles the game elements, including the container and buttons.

### JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including:

- Randomly generating the computer's choice.
- Comparing the user's choice with the computer's choice.
- Displaying the result using alert messages.

## Future Improvements

- Add better styling and animations to enhance the user experience.
- Display the results directly on the web page instead of using alert messages.
- Keep track of the score and display it on the page.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for game logic (currently embedded in the HTML file).
